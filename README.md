# Mask R-CNN for Text Detection
### Introduction
* A text detector based on Mask R-CNN is used, and the methods are mainly inspired by fully convolutional networks. First, CNN is adopted to detect text blocks, from which character candidates are extracted. Then FPN is used to predict the corresponding segmentation masks. Last, segmentation mask is used to Ô¨Ånd suitable rectangular bounding boxes for the text instances. 

* This is an implementation of [Mask R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870) on Python 3, Keras, and TensorFlow. The model generates bounding boxes and segmentation masks for each instance of an object in the image. It's based on Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and a ResNet101 backbone.
